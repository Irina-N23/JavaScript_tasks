Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.

I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating rhythm,
I'm all a-quiver.
